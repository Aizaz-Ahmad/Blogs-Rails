<h1>Articles</h1>
We have public <%= Article.public_count %> blogs out of <%= Article.count%>
<ul>
 <% @articles.each do |article| %>
    <% unless article.archived? %>
        <li>
            <!--The resources method also sets up URL and path helper methods 
            that we can use to keep our code from depending on a specific route configuration. 
            The values in the "Prefix" column above plus a suffix of _url or _path form the names of these helpers.
            For example, the article_path helper returns "/articles/#{article.id}" when given an article.  -->
            
            <!-- <a href="<%= article_path(article)%>"><%= article.title %></a>
            The link_to helper renders a link with its first argument as the link's text and its second argument as the link's destination. 
            If we pass a model object as the second argument, link_to will call the appropriate path helper to convert the object to a path -->
            <%= link_to article.title, article%>
        </li>
    <% end %>
 <% end %>
</ul>

<%= link_to "New Article", new_article_path %>
